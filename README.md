10 hour challange

This Android application retrieves news feeds and shows the 10 recent articles.

The application has a listview where it shows the articles. Each row contains title, date and an image if the article contains one.
If the user clicks one of the articles a popup toast will be shown with more descriptions.


Future implementations would be to replace the popup text with another fragment within the listview 
that contains the description. 
One thought is when user clicks the fragment with more description it will switch page for a fullscreen view with the whole article.
