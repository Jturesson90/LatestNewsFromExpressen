10 hour challange

By Jesper Turesson


## About
This Android application retrieves news feeds and shows the 10 recent articles.

It got a listview where it shows the articles. Each row contains title, date and an image if the article contains one.
If the user clicks one of the articles a popup toast will be shown with more descriptions.


## Future
Future implementations would be to replace the popup text with another fragment that contains the description 
within the listview. This could be done with transform animations for more visually appealing.

One thought is when user clicks the fragment with more description it will switch the page for an fullscreen view of the article.
